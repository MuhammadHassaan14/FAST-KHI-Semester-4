Paper Automata Project
Dear All, I have been waiting for your projects in Paper Automata. 
I am forwarding you some of the ideas (just for reference, not to make them): You may select the title no two groups within the Section will have the same
project.


DFA Simulation with flipping states
NFA to DFA conversion model
Turing Machine with movable tape
Stack simulation for PDA (Pushdown Automata)
Vending machine FSM using cams and levers
Traffic light control automaton
Elevator control simulation using levers
Morse code encoder using rotating wheels
ATM state transitions (card insert, pin, cash, eject)
Coffee machine state controller
Binary counter with paper flaps
Flip-flop circuit with physical toggling
Boolean expression evaluator with gears
2-bit FSM transition simulator
Dancing robot using crank and cam
Head nodding puppet (yes/no)
Jumping frog paper machine
Clapping hands figure
Flower blooming animation
Rotating geometric patterns
Clockwork swirl made of linked paper gears
Heart pumping simulation
Orbital planets with rotation
Earthquake vibration demonstrator
Pulley-based muscle movement model
Dice roll automaton (random number)

Material Use for Paper Autoamta ( you may use following items)
Wooden skewers or straws (for axles)
Paper clips, glue, scissors
Rubber bands (for elasticity)
Tape, pins, toothpicks
Submit your project Proposal and the Project within 2 weeks of time.
You need to provide the video how does the paper automaton is working
Concept behind it
and physical automaton.
